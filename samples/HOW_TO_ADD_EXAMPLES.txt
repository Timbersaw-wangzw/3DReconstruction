How to create new examples under the MVG tree:
--------------------------------------------------------

1) Go to [MVG]/samples

2) Create a directory with the example name, e.g. "foo" ->
   [MVG]/samples/foo/
   
3) Create the C++ file and save it as "test.cpp":
   [MVG]/samples/foo/test.cpp
   
4) Add the example name to any of the lists in:
   [MVG]/cmakemodules/DefineExamples.cmake

5) In the build directory, run "cmake . -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON"

6) An automatically generated CMake script will be created in:
   [MVG]/samples/foo/CMakeLists.txt
   
7) Add both files to svn: 
   svn add [MVG]/samples/foo/CMakeLists.txt [MVG]/samples/foo/test.cpp

done!
