#3d reconstruction

The library main changes OpenMVG and libmv two libraries, mainly for the reconstruction of a multi-view geometry.

How to build the library reference MRPT.
Inside multi-thread code reference OSG.
Another part of the design reference OpenCV and PCL.

At present the entire library simply modify the OpenMVG and libmv, the purpose is to learn and understand the library about algorithms and design. When finishing graduate school, I do not have much time to modify it.
If you like it ,I hope we can modify it.
